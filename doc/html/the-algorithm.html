<h1>The algorithm</h1>
<p>Describes the algorithm used in the Arm<sup>®</sup> Allinea Studio/Arm<sup>®</sup> Forge Trials package tutorial.</p>
<p>The application in this tutorial performs the following calculation:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>C = A * B + C
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A, B, and C are double-precision square matrices. In this first version, the algorithm is written in parallel using MPI and includes one master process and several worker processes. The application performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The master process initializes matrices A, B, and C.</li>
<li>The master process sends the entire matrix B, along with slices of A and C, to the worker processes.</li>
<li>The master and worker processes perform the matrix multiplication function on the domain that has been given to the processes, and each process computes a slice of C.</li>
<li>The master process retrieves all slices of C and puts the results into matrix C.</li>
<li>The master process writes the results of C in a file.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="parallel-algorithm.png" alt="Description of the parallel algorithm"/>
</div>
<p>The figure shows how all processes contribute in parallel to the creation of the result in matrix C.</p>
<p>This package includes C/C++, Fortran, and Python versions of this application.</p>
